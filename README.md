# Project 3 - Odyssey

This project is not currently deployed as it is a WIP. 

The Odyssey site was produced by myself as part of WDI-30 in Sydney, Australia. It is a solo project that is helping us prepare for our future development roles. This is also a passion project of mine that will continue to be updated as my skills progress.

Below is a screen shot of the landing page that the user sees upon visiting this site:

## Objectives of Project 3
- Have a backend for the project which is in Ruby on Rails
- Have a front end that can be in React, although does not have to be.
- This app has three models in Rails: Users, Trips and Stops
- I have used the following Gems: 'rack-cors', 'pry-rails', 'bcrypt' and 'geocoder'.
- Heroku: This app has been uploaded to Heroku on the backend and that is where I pull the JSON data from.

## Built With
- Ruby on Rails
- React.js
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

Below are screen shots of the different graphs that can be viewed on the site:

### Login Page
This page allows users to Log In to an existing account or create a new account.

### Add Stops
This allows users to enter stops from the sidebar and view them as a list in order of selection

### Itinery Page
This page allows users to view and modify stop information. Remove legs from the trip and view their saved trips (When Logged In).

## Scope of Project as of 12-03-2019
- Can Enter an Origin & Destination
- Can add stops in between origin and destination
- Can view stops in an itinerary

## Pain Points
- We only had a week and this was the first time I had used React in a solo project.
- Trying to configure Google Maps with React, finding the right package to suit my needs
- JSON Web Tokens

## TODO
- Make the site mobile friendly
- Create login functionality
- Add form to add stop information 
- Delete trips
- Find Google Maps API that allows me to load the trip on the map

## Big Thanks
A big thank you to our instructor, Joel Turnbull for his help and assistance in the project. As well as, to Linna Liu and Yianni Moustakas for your help and trouble shooting skills to guide us with some of our pain points. This project was started in March of 2019 and will continue to be developed.
